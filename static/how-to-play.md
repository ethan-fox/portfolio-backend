# Three Beasts - How to Play

Every day, you will be presented with 3 "puzzles". Your job is to guess the correct year in which the puzzle info is sourced from. **All solutions will take place from 1947 or later.**

Your goal is to achieve an _*Accuracy score*_ of 100. Score is calculated on an exponential decay; the further away you are from the correct answer, the more points are deducted from your total.

Each puzzle contains 2 primary segments you should pay attention to:

1. **Hints**: These are at the top of the card. They will present contextual information about the list of Players you are viewing.
2. **Players**: The list of baseball players which qualify for the hint.

Here is some helpful info about some of the puzzles you may encounter:

* **Award Voting**: Displays, at most, the Top 10 vote-getters for the award. As an added layer of difficulty, these lists are displayed **out of order**.
* **Starters**: Provides the player who played the most games at that position for their team in the given season. If a starter played less than 90 games for their team, an additional "(Platoon)" label is presented. (This most often occurs with Catchers) 
* **Rate Stats**: Rate stats (ERA, OPS, etc.) only include players who are **qualified** according to MLB's [official rule book](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/rate-stats-qualifiers). This means 162 Innings Pitched or 502 Plate Appearances.
